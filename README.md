# My Favotire Board Game
## Terraforming Mars

Terraforming Mars is a board game played between 1-5 players. The game takes anywhere between 2-8+ hours. In this board game the players take on the roles of different coorporations to terraform mars. To terraform a player must take one or several of these actions: raise the temperature and oxygen, build cities, make oceans and greeneries. Once all the terraforming requirements are met, whomever gained the most points by terraforming the most wins.

### What I Like About Terraforming Mars 
- Makes you think critically
- Can use different strategies for every game
- Every game is different even if you play with the same coorporation
