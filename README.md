## My Favotire Weekend Activity: Terraforming Mars

Terraforming Mars is a borad game played between 1-5 players. The game takes anywhere between 2-8+ hours. In this boargame the players take on the roles of different coorporatios to terraform mars. To terraform a player must take one or several of these actinos: raise the temperature and oxygen, build cities, make oceans and greeneries. Once all the terraforminng rquirements are met, whomever gained the most points by terraforming the most wins.
